# Docker note & some problems solved
This File recorded the problems and code when I learned Docker.</br>

If you have some problems you cannot solved,</br>
you can try to see ***Problems.md*** to check whether the problem existed or not. </br>

Also, there is a file ***Instructions.md*** which can help you to try and memorize.</br>

If you have some problems and code you want to reshare or somethig I wrote wrong,</br> 
you can commit your file, and i will check and merge your commit.</br>

By the way, there has some reference about k8s, i think this is helpful for learning.</br>

Hope this file can help everyone and get some inspiration !
